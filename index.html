            <p>This week we'll be discussing the concept of
                <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> -
                <br>
                another important game guideline.

        <h3>Youtubability</h3>
        <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity
                <br>
                of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
            <br>
            <br>
            Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
            <br>
            full potential of your game by working on
            <br>
            getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
            <br>
            games.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many elements can be used to make your
            <br>
            game clearer:
            <br>
            <br>
            For instance, ask yourself if a user's inte-
            <br>
            raction with the game is evident, for
            <br>
            example, can she tell wich character she
            <br>
            <strong>controls?</strong> Is she the <strong>objecive clear?</strong> Does it
            <br>
            look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
            <br>
            game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
            <br>
            seconds (too long!)
            <br>
            <br>
            Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
            <br>
            the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
            <br>
            Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
            <br>
            orange here) and instantly recognized as
            <br>
            a threat.

                If you want to run user tests with
                <br>
                friends and family or even random
                <br>
                people in the street, it is interesting to
                <br>
                show them the 30 second video before
                <br>
                making them try to prototype in order
                <br>
                to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from
                <br>
                the video vs. the actual game they try.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements
                <br>
                that <strong>help understand the objective and
                    <br>
                    controls</strong> of the game, like with the
                <br>
                target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
                <br>
                Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
                <br>
                Car with the space dedicated to
                <br>
                drawing.

                People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their
                    <br>
                    phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when
                <br>
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should
                    <br>
                    also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
                    <br>
                    someone watches iton a small screen</strong>. With an average watch time of 3
                <br>
                to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
    
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
                <br>
                YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
                <br>
                for your game videos.
